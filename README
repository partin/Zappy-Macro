Zappy Macro
===========

DECRIPTION
  A keyboard macro utility running as a loadable kernel module.

USAGE
  The Scroll Lock key toggles recording of a macro on and off.
  The key to the left of 1 (on my keyboard) replays the macro.
  The Scroll Lock LED indicates that a macro is being recorded.

USAGE DEATILS
  To avoid the playback button to generate undesired input, I
  am using xmodmap to disable it like this:

    xmodmap -e "keycode 49 ="

IMPLEMENTATION
  Listens to the keyboard using a keyboard notifier and
  playbacks macros using a virtual keyboard input device.
